A template for kick starting a Cloudflare worker project with validation of Auth0 JWTs.

[`index.js`](https://github.com/bcnzer/cloudflare-worker-template-auth0-jwt/blob/master/index.js) is the content of the Workers script. Note the use of the `IsValidJwt` function.

[`auth0-jwt-validation.js`](https://github.com/bcnzer/cloudflare-worker-template-auth0-jwt/blob/master/auth0-jwt-validation.js) is where all the validation work occurs.
